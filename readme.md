## HTML5 Validation Engine

**This is only a first draft for a plugin that augment HTML5 form validation with custom messages. Not ready for production use.

This jQuery plugin provide a container for hanling form validation on top of regular HTML5 validation. It augment the current set of validation provided by HTML5, enable you to change error prompts design & fallback for older browsers.

It works the same way as you would use the html5 validator. add $(document).html5ValidationEngine() & never worry about it anymore.
